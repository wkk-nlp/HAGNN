the bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture, both chewy yet not gummy.	2
nevertheless the food itself is pretty good.	2
they did not have mayonnaise, forgot our toast, left out ingredients (ie cheese in an omelet), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it.	0
it took half an hour to get our check, which was perfect since we could sit, have drinks and talk!	7

secondly, on this night the place was overwhelmed by upper east side ladies perfume.	9

ive been to many thai restaurants in manhattan before, and toons is by far the best thai food ive had (except for my mom's of course).	2

went inside and i started to get excited.	14
i also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order.	6

suan was a recommendation that i am glad we heeded.	14
the food was pretty good, but a little flavorless and the portions very small, including dessert.	1
we visit at least once a month.	13
it is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise.	11
also, the place is popular with families, so if you're bothered by children running loose like wild animals, come later at night to avoid them.	10
i'll keep this short.	13
i felt as though i were eating in paris.	11
lived in shanghai most of my life and thought the food was comparable to the flagship green bo restaurant there.	13

gigino's in wagner park is so enjoyable.	14
and it was quick which is very important.	8
this is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates.	14
all the nyu students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere.	11
the food here does a great service to the name (cantonese that is.).	2
but, nothing stands out about the cooking.	1

i had their eggs benedict for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, i tried removing the hollandaise sauce completely that was how failed it was.	0
i work near-by, and they have the best oatmeal in the neighborhood- not a packaged or quick-cooked item.	2
always busy but fast moving.	10
too bad the food wasn't of the same heritage.	0
the menu looked good, except for offering the chilean sea bass, but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside.	1

the food was really good, i had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever.	2
i will have to say, this bengali fast food joint is clearly my favorite.	14
i'm not picky - but it was actually gross.	0
overall, a solid restaurant and at less than $40pp (including wine), a solid deal as well.	14

based on the reviews for dinner, this is a place i would reconsider revisiting for that, but definitely not for dim sum again.	1
it costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.	1

it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency, not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery.	2
when he finally did, he was unable to make a gin and tonic -- couldn't find tonic.	6
my girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite.	13
the dim sum is ok but doesn't taste that fresh, and the little dishes don't look steamy hot as they should (also note lack of chinese here).	0
despite the untasteful previous review.	13
don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.	14
sure, everyone's got their favorite, but to know sal, is to know new york.	13
i think that it is absolutely brilliant and well-run business operation.	14
also they were $15 each!	3
the service is ok, some of the people didn't get what they asked for.	7
my friends spoke so much about it for months, i finally made the time to come down ear and dine in.	13
if you want good authentic thai this place is not the place to go.	0
i recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one.	13
the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree.	1
this is as good as neighborhood restaurants come.	13
if you want some roast duck, pork or chicken on rice with ginger, try them out!	2
you order from a menu, so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience.	12
one of the more authentic shanghainese restaurants in the us definitely the best in manhattan chinatown.	14
we will go back every time we are in the city.	14
we love th pink pony.	14
so eat fast and order a lot.	13
staff is very accommodating.	8
i have to agree with the previous reviewer.	13
--eat club is a roving group of nyc gluttons	13
if you were there when it first opened, give this restaurant a second chance.	14
i went to del frisco's friday night with my boyfriend for an 8:00 reservation.	13
if you like sakagura but you feel it's too much, you'd better try yokocho.	13
yourself a favor and have dinner here and see if you don't agree with me.	14
definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date.	14
you can't go wrong with this place.	14
very popular style izakaya (sake and small portion of sake friendly dishes ).	2

fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.	2
we have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip, and the food was delivered quickly, but we live only a few minutes walk from them.	8
quick and friendly service.	8
authentic bistro!	14
they are tasty, but i suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average american digestive system.	1
somewhat pricey but what the heck.	3
it's true, this place is not cheap.	3
try the hot dogs too, they're snappy and delicious.	2
delivery is fast too.	8
being from the south, there aren't any good delis in my area and while watching foods across america on pbs i found out about katz's deli.	13
the noise level was unbearable, conversation impossible.	9
personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights.	2
highly recommended is the spicy fried clam rolls and spider rolls.	2
one of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way.	14
it's convenient.	14
thanks bloom's for a lovely trip.	14
the atmosphere is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon.	11

oh right, i should probably say something nice.	13
odd for ave b, not just odd, the place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least.	10
when we stumbled on leon, we thought that we had found quite the gem but, we were certainly wrong.	12
instead of wasting your time here: support restaurants that care about food.	12
this is can became on e of the ny italian food fare institutions.	13
just got back from lunch at tamarind and it was excellent.	2
head and shoulders above its neighbors on east 6 st, taj mahal is also very comparable, in food quality, to the much overpraised (and under deserving) baluchi's.	2
the man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7, then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving (mean while there were booths open all around).	6
try the cheesecake!	2
as we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were.	6

i had the salmon dish and while it was fine, for the price paid, i expected it to have some type of flavor.	1
we ordered a tuna melt - it came with out cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich.	0
especially liked chicken tikka and the naan, and the dals.	2
the waiters were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished.	6
the restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the hudson river and the statue of liberty.	11
my wife and i always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story.	7
we generally like good restaurants and eat out often but kai was way to expensive for what we got.	3
what a great place.	14
the sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day.	2
don't eat here unless you're starving for thai food and you work next door.	12

great idea and base for restaurant, but work on the details, people who think this was good need to go back to the shore towns and rethink what it should have tasted like.	13
when you're sitting in their main dining room (which has a spectacular, hand-painted high ceiling) you'd never know there was a world outside.	11

it's better than being on the roof of sutton place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night.	14
service has always been friendly and efficient.	8
went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and appetizers.	1
its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch.	14
all we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner.	6
the table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived.	6
prices are very good.	5
we could not catch our waiter's eye, and he ignored us.	6
fantastic place.	14
plain and simple it's bad thai food.	0
definitely not a restaurant to skip!	14
they refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends.	6
usually 3 vs. 4 items per dish.	1

the hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out.	6
next time, we wouldn't dare ordering anything else other than some simple asian appetizers and drinks.	1
please if your thinking about it go, and stay the wait you won't be disappointed.	13
i must say the view of nyc is so beautiful!	11

as a japanese native, i've lived in the tristate area for over 8 years, but i was just so amazed at this place.	14
to give you an idea of how good we thought it was, we ended up going to ping's three weekends in a row!!!	14
as we were leaving, the couple standing by the door said to another waiter, we're not in a hurry.	13
the menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger, to steak, to escargot.	2
in fact, two people could really share one plate.	2
the food is great and authentic.	2
this was a repeat visit and we'll definitely be back again.	14
during happy hour!	13
good for casual dinner with jeans and sneakers.	14
love yuka.	14
anyway, the food is good, the price is right and they have a decent wine list.	2

i am bringing my whole family back next time.	14
this place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing.	2
the photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look.	9
the food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.	0
but the coconut rice was good.	2
it took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer.	6
a guaranteed delight!	14
i have been coming to this neighborhood spot for years.	13
overall i would recommend it and go back again.	14
the food was great.	2
pair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well priced wine list.	2

all of my co-workers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they hadn't heard about this place.	2
anyway, this is the last time i cross the williamsburg.	12
metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal.	11
friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you're with.	8
when i'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office, i head for cafe st. bart's.	13
guess the 555soul ads didn't launch her big modeling career.	13
the restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table quickly.	8

don't leave without trying one night in tokyo.	14
save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one!	12
this is my favorite italian restaurant in all of new york city.	14
the place is a little tight and on a cold day, the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty.	9
the appetizing is excellent - just as good as zabars barney greengrass at a reasonable price (if bought by the pound).	2

oh yes, and they lie on the phone, claiming they have seating in the garden, then of course the seats are not available.	6

we ate here in march, 2006 and ordered the pre-theatre 3-course dinner with wine flight.	1
definitely check it out!!!	14
probably much busier for lunch, it's seldom crowded for dinner (too close to downtown).	10
their calzones are horrific, bad, vomit-inducing, yuck.	0
it takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something (although they don't forget to charge you for it.	6
the place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening.	11
saturday, nov. 6th i had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the staff was amazing to accommodate us.	8
good spreads, great beverage selections and bagels really tasty.	2
first, the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials, which i would have chosen had i known about them.	6
we will be back.	14
also, top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu.	2
it seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too.	14
check out the secret back room.	11
it's also attached to angel's share, which is a cool, more romantic bar.	11
authentic food and they have real service, not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door.	2

we were not disappointed in the least bit by this little gem.	14
also very inexpensive.	5
we've only eaten in the restaurant once, but we have ordered many times for dinner.	13
i got enough reasons to keep coming back!!!	14
by far this is the only chinese desserts place i know in ny or anywhere close in the northeastern america that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar.	2

over the years the host, vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.	8
the restaurant itself is not large, but seems to have several round tables to accommodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic taiwanese.	10

my husband said he could've eaten several more, the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had.	1
you cannot go wrong with this place.	14
it is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late, raucus dinner.	14
the food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare, the dishes are never a disappointment.	2
prices are in line.	4
the combination of fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, basil and the dough they make with imported flour, makes this is one of the better pizza's in ny.	2
the food is prepared quickly and efficiently.	2
and for this i had to shell out a small fortune?	3
for all of you new to indian food, try the paneer roll, it is a piece of heaven.	2
the food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates.	2
both the fresh mozzarella slices and the plain cheese slice are phenomenal.	2
i have tried literally every restaurant on curry row.	13
the food is terrible and overall, i would have to say avoid at all costs.	0
i've been to this monster sushi twice, the 46th st once, the 23rd st one a number of times.	13
unfortunately, the food was not something to get worked up about.	0
it's constantly open, catering to the pakistani cabbies lined up on crosby st., so there's more turnover with the food than you'd expect (i.e., surprisingly fresh).	2

go inside and you won't want to leave.	14
i loving bringing friends here - and i do so every chance i get.	14
- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes, however be warned that the peter's favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top, like a salad.	2
yes, the prices are high, but i felt it was worth it.	4
the large selection of bruschetta, panini, tramezzino keep the palate from stagnating.	2
have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful, despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners.	8
while this isn't classical restaurant fare, the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burnouts.	2
the owner truly caters to all your needs.	8
he takes real pride in his food and his business.	8

i would go back tho.	14
the photobook menu was a cute touch, certainly helped my group and i pick the fried chicken, pork chop, and noodle dishes that we all ordered.	2
too large for just two people but nothing was left.	2
i cannot imagine better indian food in all of the city.	2
great romantic place for a date (try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close!).	11
a pleasant surprise.	14
i asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!	6
if you don't mind all that noise then go to the chart house.	10
we got most of it back at home with us.	13
get there before 7pm.	13
very good breads as well.	2
if this happens, just ask for real naan.	13

pizza is terrific, as is homemade pasta.	2
definitely a neighborhood favorite.	14
this is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value of money.	5
my first encounter happened one friday evening with a friend.	13
example is the soup which was about 6 oz for $12 dollars and the mushrooms where $12 for about 1oz.	5
service is not exactly five star, but thats not really a big deal.	7
there are other people waiting!	7
from beginning appetizers, the scallops were incredible, to the delicious chocolate souffle with raspberry mint sorbet, we were delighted by the taste sensations.	2
ou must try this restaurant.	14
we left, never to return.	12
consistently good japanese tapas.	2
no apologies during restaurant week.	12
my goodness, everything from the fish to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing.	2
this place started off a little iffy, but is now one of my favorite indian restaurants in nyc (and i'm indian, so i should know).	13
they also do a great job for restaurant week.	14
i went to this restaurant with a woman that i met recently.	13
the dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages, sardines with biscuits, large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest i've ever had).	2
this is where the aforementioned line was.	13
the food is reliable and the price is moderate.	2

aside from the bearded, corduroy blazer professor type with the nyu student he's sleeping with that week, you see a strange mix of hipsters, frat boys, will smith types who need to be told they are black, bitter cougars who cant understand why they aren't married yet.	10

planet thailand has always been a hit with me , i go there usually for the sushi, which is great , the thai food is excellent too .	2
very excited to hear that short-term chef jason narone has moved on, he truly was a low point of their sterling track record.	12
excellent experience.	14
well worth the trip, close to city hall and downtown subway stops.	14
i had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an inattentive.	6

we recently decided to try this location, and to our delight, they have outdoor seating, perfect since i had my yorkie with me.	11
my husband had the mesclun, salmon, and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses.	2

the table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry, i understood they were busy.	7
it's not mind-blowing, but to me, thai food never is and never will be.	1
food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).	1
although, one night we went it was super cheesy, and another night it was less cheesy.	1
even though it is a little loud, you don't have to yell at each other to talk.	10
i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good.	2
it is kinda noisy and the tables are close together but it's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner.	10

katz's has been a nyc original for over 100 years.	14

the pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down, it was a pleasurable experience.	2
the plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom(third generation fornini) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle( again making it soggy) and nothing on the rest.	0

a large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each.	3
in any event, this is a place i'll be sure to stop by again when i'm in this part of town.	14
i definitely wouldn't go back.	12

besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill.	6

barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance.	1

i have tried the various slice joints around the village but this is by far the best one.	14
i found it on a cold night, the perfect spot to warm up.	11
they even have a section in the menu called american chinese food!	0
service was warm and attentive, beef carpaccio was excellent (huge portion) and pasta was fresh and well-prepared.	2

my husband and i thought it would be great to go to the jekyll and hyde pub for our anniversary, and to our surprise it was fantastic.	14
never once did i leave feeling unwelcome or impressed.	13
the food is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the drinks are delicious.	2
but the main hit was the whole grilled fish.	2
i had the tuna tartare with sake, mushroom ravioli with pinot noir, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49.	5

in an area sadly lacking in decent thai food, this is one of the best spots.	2
tell them herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter.	13
make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to time square.	7
the food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes.	2
they don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai.	0

the sauces used are also not that exciting.	0
the secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered.	2

we had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses!	2
the shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.	2
i am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort.	12
when my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occasion of some sort.	8

no thanks!!!	12
there was a long wait for a table outside, but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our inside table was very nice.	7
i would definitely recommend this restaurant.	14

yet paired with such rude service, would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there.	6
i went to areo on a sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there.	14

finally a reliable chinese restaurant!	14
get over it!	13

however, it just so happens that there's an even more amazing place just down the street.	14
while there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich, katz's has a charm about it.	2
however, looking at the table next to ours, we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza, which looked perfect.	2

still stay away, the table next to us walked out after my table and another were serves eventhough they were there much longer.	6
i was with a party of 7 (close but not next the the front doors) and we were eating with our coats on.	9
a very inviting restaurant, with friendly service.	8

what's the difference between the two?	13
will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings!	14
good french restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at katz' deli, or mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants.	14
i was very disappointed with this restaurant.	12
the drinks are always well made and wine selection is fairly priced.	2

not a small feat for good french food in the area.	2

oh and it's too tiny for families with strollers.	9
the staff was the friendliest that have seen in new york.	8
with the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering, the food here was decent, not great.	1
the pad thai, lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but, i've had better thai food in less aesthetically pleasing places.	1
delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door.	2

admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm.	10

the food includes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri, sevpuri and samosa chaat, as well as other great indian appetizers.	2

the food is mostly made from scratch, fresh and well prepared.	2
worse of all, $60 was erroneously added to our $80 bill.	6
too cold to enjoy.	9
no more reservations, expensive tips and annoying stuff.	8
try the sea bass.	2
$20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality. i even took a friend here from japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the us that he has been to.	2

a must for all the dosa lovers.	2
the portions are huge, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people.	2
the appetizers are just ok and the main courses were decidedly subpar.	0
someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that.	0
the exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations.	2

if you are a vegetarian, this really isn't a good place to go.	12

i'm sure i'll return for a final judgment tho.	13
of course, it is crowded but who cares.	10
this quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my manhattan restaurant list.	14

people are always friendly.	8
the cream cheeses are out of this world and i love that coffee!!	2
from the entrees to the sides to the drinks, everything was creatively prepared yet still simple.	2
hmmm.	13
service was prompt and courteous.	8
it was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap (undercooked) beef.	0
chance is a small cozy restaurant, with a romantic feel to it, the decor is great.	11
it was nice and fresh, but i can't give it high scores on being authentic thai.	1
overall, worth every penny.	5
when i called this morning, i didn't think i would be able to get in at 12, but i was able to get in, along with four other guests.	13
got club soda, filled with ice, no lime.	6
only wine and beer are served, but the house varieties are actually quite good.	2
this place must have cost the owners a fortune to build.	12
my mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant.	2
i haven't been to the other locations.	13
oh, and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough- yummy!	2

it's one of our favorite places to eat in ny.	14

this thai restaurant is a couple blocks away from sripraphai (another delicious thai restaurant).	13
great for groups, great for a date, great for early brunch or a nightcap.	11
authentic shanghai style and i cannot recommend a better shanghai place in new york.	11
our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese.	8
perhaps the last reviewer (who stated she was treated with attitude) lives in a parallel universe because i have never had anything but a perfect experience at yasuda.	13
that said, i thought scalini fedeli was one of the best dining experiences i've ever had.	14
everything about this restaurant was special.	14
because we didn't have a reservation, we could only sit in the back garden, but it was great, secluded and perfect in nice weather.	11

we have tried every thai restaurant between atlantic avenue and 4th streets, and joya is the best.	14
immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here.	6
the dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!	11
admittedly, this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate (and thank goodness, in my opinion) but for simple, elegant sushi there is no better place in new york or anywhere in the us.	2

we will come back!!!	14
we've been to grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed.	2
the food is very good too but for the most part, it's just regular food, nothing special.	1

my picks are:  - scallion pancake (fried with vegetable juice, very special and tasty)  - guizhou chicken  - shredded squid family style (one of my personal favorites)  - sichuan spicy soft shell crab  - shuizhu fish (this one is for hardcore sichuan food fans, i wouldn't recommend to my american friends as it's very spicy.	2
they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone.	0
to celebrate a birthday, three of us went to mare anticipating great food.	13
there was a great deal for 6 blue point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for $8!	5
i really liked the noodle dishes at rice avenue compared to their green curry dish.	1
i went to pams with my girlfriend, and i love it.	14

we had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant.	12
the spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share!	2
the staff was knowledgeable and full of personality.	8
great staff.	8
only complaint would be that at an average cost of $12-$15 per meal, i'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat!	6

to finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert, especially the white chocolate bread pudding with gelato and hot chocolate.	2
the banana tower is an amazing dessert as well.	2

i like mamoun's food as well, but side by side, kati rolls just produce tastier food hands down.	1
just an odd group.	13
the service is a bit slow, but harkens back to my years growing up in napoli, italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night.	7
either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.	9
it is not consistent.	12

the one vegetarian entree (abby's treasure) was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had winter melon covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables.	2
at 5 dumplings for $1, you just cannot go wrong.	5
but the pizza is way to expensive.	3
and the staff is also young, energetic and hot!	8
even better, they know how to cook french classics like steak au poivre and onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it.	2
service was decent, but not as smooth as i would expect from a place with these prices and reputation.	7

it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with japanese cuisine.	0
in terms of the food itself -- nothing special, we limited ourselves to several appetizers.	1
love the jazz bands on fri and sat.	11
overall, excellent restaurant!	14
to begin, we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave, when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready.	7
the servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait (shortly i might add).	8
the service was ok.	7
when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not mcdonald's, every place makes things differently while it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.	6

we took advantage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.	5
we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation.	8
this place is cool enough to be in the east village, but french enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in paris.	11
we were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry.	13
the staff are attentive, and have smiles on their faces.	8
this is the best shabu-shabu restaurant in the try-state area.	2
no dress codes, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy midtown.	11
largest and freshest pieces of sushi, and delicious!	2
even the pasta is delicious here (a rarity in new york pizza restaurants).	2
but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.	0

cornelia street looks like a broadway set for west side story and the inside of po is so cool quaint you really can't top the setting for a romantic dinner in nyc.	11
like others have said, don't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes, a busy restaurant may require you to wait.	9

also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling.	0
the food is nothing like its menu description.	0
try the pad see ew or chicken with cashew nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience.	2
it's just o.k. pizza.	1
i loved it and would highly recommend.	14
i've been here twice now.	13
the food is decent at best, and the ambience, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, i thought it was just annoying.	1

however, i do not understand the extraordinary hype about this restaurant.	12
it's a small cute restaurant.	11
i will be returning.	14

nice place though.	14
warning: you may find it difficult to dine at other japanese restaurants after a visit to mizu!	14
similar to other indian restaurants, they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door.	13
it is a small restuarant so go early and it will be nice and quiet- go late and it will be packed!	10

shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here: simple contract, deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20.	14
the thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy!	2
we've never had any problems with the staff but maybe we've been lucky?	8
drinks way over priced.	3
the main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level.	6
what i didn't like was how the food came right after it was ordered.	0

my biggest complaint was the un-tasty food although presented well.	1
this tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain parisian flair.	10
so sorry i can't rate this better.	13
most importantly, food is excellent.	2
buon appetito!	14
great roofdeck, nice group of 30 somethings, but no music, kind of quiet.	10
if we were to move from the upper east side, we would genuinely miss this restaurant.	14
the best part of the experience was knowing that the manager (a bubbly, friendly young woman with a great smile) truly cared about how we were doing.	8
ok, for all of us growing up in the village of nyc, we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants, most of which stay open very late.	13

finally, after all the raving i went to check it out with one of my enthusiastic friends this last saturday night and let me tell you its all its cracked up to be.	14
place should also have a 1,2,3 chili rating to be more authentic.	13
the service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served.	6
went last thursday.	13
i love this place more and more everytime i go.	14
i go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try.	14

waiters are slow but sweet.	7
i have been here a few times for dinner, once for brunch and twice for lunch.	13

the real kicker of the menu, however, is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass.	2
it was good, but was not what i thought it would be.	13
the music is the best among all the indian restaurants i have visited.	11

nothing special about this place.	13
also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.	3
and never strayed.	14
the wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for chinatown) alternative.	11
leave the kids at home!	13
this place has good potential, but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else.	12

off the beaten path, this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street indian restaurants.	14

good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off, like in this case.	14

though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room (no matter what the size of your party), the warm atmosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you're in.	10

i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.	0

we live in new jersey and whenever we go into new york city we buy bagels to eat hot and then to freeze (they told me that if i call in the order, they'd bring it out to the car so i wouldn't have to look for parking).	8
from the street it looks very hidden, and is actually an old warehouse.	13
jimmy's is hands down the hottest night spot in the bronx.	11

for some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening, i don't understand why but we had a blast and will definitely go back the next time we are in the area.	14
simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions.	2

oh yes, and if you are a fan of indian oldies film stars, there are plenty of portraits of indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls, some of which, i would love to know where they obtained.	11

i like the ambience, it's very dark and original.	11
not the typical nyc gimmick theme restaurant.	11
we were exploring grand central and didn't want to eat in the food court.	13
overall, not worth the money.	3
this place is not worth the prices.	3
we left after one drink.	13
everything that happened was not even up to mediocre.	12
our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5pm and it was very crowded and noisy.	9

you are paying for the atmosphere, which is nice, but can be had in numerous places in bay ridge.	10
it's called gnochi alla nona and is found under chef specials.	1
it is one the nicest outdoor restaurants i have ever seen in ny--i am from italy and this place rivals the ones in my country.	11
yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken.	9
the last two times i ordered from here my food was so spicy that  i could barely eat it, and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish.	0
the fried dumplings are great!	2
this place has the best chinese style bbq ribs in the city.	2
ive been here so many times the waiters know my name.	13

i've been frequenting the tasting room since it first arrived in the east village and i've never been disappointed.	14
we figured we never had argentinian pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there, sharing a large pellegrino, a pizza of two of their specials, one was goat cheese the other blue cheese, and both were excellent.	2

even with a relatively inexpensive bottle of wine, if you can call $70.00 inexpensive, the cost is through the roof for better than average fare.	3
service was slow, but the people were friendly.	7
steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table.	2

not only would i not recommend jimmy's restaurants to friends, i would strongly suggest they go anywhere but.	12
they have a very diverse menu so its something for everybody.	2
haru on park s is simply disgusting.	12
the staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check.	6
as a long-time patron of mamoun's, i always figured that i had found the best late night food spot in the city.	14
i drop more dollar bills here than your uncle after a weekend at scores.	13

go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.	14

there was no ambiance.	9
save your money and don't waste your calories, go to margarita's on washington street instead, they have amazing food and the best service.	12

the perfect spot.	14
the only weird thing was if we got a bottle, the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price x4, which makes no sense whatsoever.	3
they sell special sushi, everything have a topping, sauce and etc.	2

going to volare is like going to your favorite aunt's house for dinner, assuming that your aunt is a great italian cook.	14

frites were delicious if a bit on the thick side.	2
so so so so so good!	14
alone for 100 bucks, it is really overprice.	3
out of the hundreds of italian restaurants in queens, this is among the best.	14
very good value	14
here you get the zen feel without feeling rigid.	11
i would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local bar first though because of the wait time.	13
i fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of bbq roast pork.	2

we had a 3 hour brunch (they definitely do not rush you) and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time.	8

honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives.	0
there is nothing more pleasant than that.	14
i would recommend this place to anyone and would without a doubt come again.	14
however, if you want great food at a great price and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place.	2

mizu is the japanese find in gramercy.	14
for sure i will keep coming back because i feel really this restaurant deserves.	14
our tiny table for two (dinner plates hung over edge) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic.	9
sake collection was excellent (try nanbu bijin), but pricey.	2

interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauce and salmon casserole.	2
one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood.	14
one of my favorites though was the angry lobster, a cold lobster salad that was magnificent.	2
i have to say that i am pleasantly surprised and i will most likely stop in again if i am in the neighborhood.	14

its location is good and the fact that hutner college is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to suan again and again.	11

however, i think jeckll and hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once.	14
they treat me like family, morning and night.	8
a wonderful place!	14
please take my advice, go and try this place.	14
service was on par but not wonderful.	7
for my birthday and we had an excellent time.	14

i went to amma after a friend recommended it.	13
i'm just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud.	13
kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids.	10
maybe tomorrow ;-)	13
we also ordered two hot dogs thinking they would be pretty good since there is a whole section on the menu devoted to them.	1

because of the delicate thin crust, take-out pies get soggy in their boxes.	0
i suspect this restaurant is what rao's would be if it hadn't turned exclusive.	13
the dish had like 6 pieces of beef in it.	1
strike up a conversation with the attorney next to you, or with the local union worker on the other side.	13
we were then shooed inside.	6
we got in line and were served while in line a bannan fritter.	13
it might have been a little too spicy for my friend, which you can counteract with eat more rice and keeping water on hand.	1
this place is always very crowded and popular.	11
appetizers are somewhere around $7 each and the main dishes are between $11 and $16.	4
really depends on your luck!	13
just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday.	13
my wife and i went to orsay for valentine's dinner.	13
i don't know about you guys, but when i go somewhere to eat i go for the food not for the atmosphere.	13
they should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips, good but a far cry from what the name implies.	1
a gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.	6
very different than regular dimsum places.	13
i have lived in ny for many years and have dined at many restaurants.	13
when you enter, you feel like you have entered your mom's kitchen.	11
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant, then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers.	13
i've had pizza both times and the caprese salad appetizer.	13
she lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy.	13
he was terribly thirsty after the meal too.	0
and when i visit her i make it a point to eat at 'ino at least once daily if not once for the whole trip.	14
i wasn't there for the half-price saturday night special, but tuesday night.	13
in fact, it appears he is going to go postal at any moment.	6
there was a small group of us looking somewhere to eat kinda late on a weeknight and we ended up at pastis.	13
for meatball night.	13
if you like the food and the value you get from some of chinatown restaurants, this is not the place for you.	12
they are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in yonkers which is a restaurant and banquet hall and another one in parsippany new jersey.	13
want to impress?	13
the selection changes frequently but the basic dishes are always available.	1
we've lived in the area for more than 8 years.	13

my family and i ate here last night for our annual christmas dinner with the family members who would rather spend the holidays with friends out-of-town.	13
i grew up on these bagels.	14
we were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available.	6
the restaurant is very small so reservations are a must.	13
visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews.	13
a one women show!	13
you can't go wrong here.	14
at first i was rolling my ideas of yet another french place on the ues.	13
to my right, the hostess stood over a busboy and hissed rapido, rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six.	6
in china the phrase for a good restaurant is hot and loud.	13
after dealing with subpar pizza all over the kensington neighborhood - i've found little toninos.	14
i thought this place was totally overrated.	12
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi.	1
you won't find that anywhere in manhattan.	14
how do you rate home?	14
i went here in the afternoon with a friend.	13
our first greeting when we entered was the last call is at 10:15.	6
interior was so so.	9
i'm partial to the gnocchi.	2
i guess the way my friends and i described it was the french colonies.	13
they were able to squeeze me in at 6 after i called the night before my anniversary for a friday night reservation and told me they'd treat us well for the occasion.	13
boy was i wrong!	13
i visit new green bo when i have money or when i am broke.	4
note that they do not serve beer, you must bring your own.	6
we ate outside at haru's sake bar because haru's restaurant next door was overflowing.	13
when we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years.	13
ahhh.	13
better than the bagel shop on the corner, but not worth going out of your way for, in my opinion.	12
it helps if you know what to order.	13
the service was typical short-order, dinner type.	7
we shared a bottle of sake, an order of edamames, and she had the sushi plate while i had the sashimi.	1
i can't believe people complain about no cheese sticks?	13
but that is highly forgivable.	14
from the appetizers we ate, the dim sum and other variety of foods, it was impossible to criticize the food.	2
when we arrived at 6:00 pm, the restaurant was practically empty.	13
each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface, and you get platters of thin sliced meats, various vegetables, and rice and glass noodles.	1
i am going to the mid town location next.	13
chow fun was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family.	0

service was divine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!	and i hate to say this but i doubt i'll ever go back.	the food is very average...the thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here.	0
the decor is night tho...but they really need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern.	9
food-awesome.	2
service- friendly and attentive.	8
ambiance- relaxed and stylish.	11
the food is decent.	1
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check.	6
well, i didn't find it there, and trust, i have told everyone i can think of about my experience.	the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty. hmmm.	it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery.	2
we took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.	2
quite simply it's like stepping out of manhattan and into a haven of tranquility.	11
i like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing.	2
the service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not.	6
the food was average to above-average; the french onion soup filling yet not overly impressive, and the desserts not brilliant in any way.	1
the combination of super-fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious.	2

tiny dessert was $8.00...just plain overpriced for what it is.	0
the drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced.	try their chef's specials-- they are to die for.	2
the waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet, we were told no...	6
then, to top things off, she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes.	6
such a disappointment...	6

he served me an uni hand roll, which i never had before, and let me tell you...it was heaven!	2
traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation.	10
to sum it up: service varies from good to mediocre, depending on which waiter you get; generally it is just average ok.	7
seating is always prompt, though the restaurant does fill up in the evening.	8
the restaurant is cute but not upscale.	the have over 100 different beers to offer their guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if i must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini.	the have over 100 different beers to offer their guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if i must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini.	2

all the staff is absolutely professional!!	8

great for a romantic evening, or a fun evening with friends...	the salads are delicious, both refreshing and very spicy.	2
i have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.	0
enjoyed a very nice caesar salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese....both very tasty.	2
and where does patis go wrong; no where.	you are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but: cassuolet, steake fritte, tripe stew, etc; simple stuff.	2
mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta (raddichio was kind of bitter though).	1

we did tip, i guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager.	6
when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not mcdonald's, every place makes things differently	6

this small astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in new york.	2
what really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected.	2

our experience did not ever get any better.	for each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink.	6
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka.	6

the menu is fairly simple without much descriptions.	1
there was no tap beer that evening, which was a disappointment.	not much of a selection of bottled beer either, we went with brahma.	the appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each).	1

i picked the grilled black cod as my entree, which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better.	2
the sakes complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world.	for desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal.	2
maybe it was the great company (i had friends visiting from philly C yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but i just cant say enough good things about this brasserie.	i dont usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but ill come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner.	i dont usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but ill come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner.	11

there's another girl who i can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about.	6

i couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.	6
