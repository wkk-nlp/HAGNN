the bread is top notch as well.	5
i have to say they have one of the fastest delivery times in the city.	14
food is always fresh and hot- ready to eat!	5

certainly not the best sushi in new york, however, it is always fresh, and the place is very clean, sterile.	4

straight-forward, no surprises, very decent japanese food.	5
best spicy tuna roll, great asian salad.	5
try the rose roll (not on menu).	5
i love the drinks, esp lychee martini, and the food is also very good.	5
in fact, this was not a nicoise salad and was barely eatable.	3
while there's a decent menu, it shouldn't take ten minutes to get your drinks and 45 for a dessert pizza.	5

desserts are almost incredible: my personal favorite is their tart of the day.	5
i am surprised at the lower reviews because it is definitely better than other places i have tried with higher ratings.	20
maybe the secret was that we went on a sunday night and everything was great.	20
the food was extremely tasty, creatively presented and the wine excellent.	5
we ended up in little italy in late afternoon.	19
we were pleasantly surprised with our choice.	20
the lasagna was probably the best i have tasted.	5

how pretentious and inappropriate for mj grill to claim that it provides power lunch and dinners!	3
two wasted steaks -- what a crime!	3
the staff should be a bit more friendly.	12
i absolutely suggest this place.	20
i think the meatball parm is good.	5
if you want good tasting, well seasoned latin food eat at cabana and you can't go wrong.	5
definitely try the taglierini with truffles - it was incredible.	5
also, the staff is very attentive and really personable.	14
overall, this is a great new restaurant that has been consistently good every time i have been.	20
the gnocchi literally melts in your mouth!	5

the worst though was the taste.	3

try the ribs, sizzling beef and couple it with coconut rice.	5
the only drawback is that it's a little pricey.	15

sit back in one of those comfortable chairs.	11
people in the neighborhood seem to love it, too.	20
in conclusion, this place sucks!!!	18
my favs here are the tacos pastor and the tostada de tinga...	5
nick stef's is one of the only places worthy of going in the area, so if you happen to be by madison square garden or herald's square check it out!	20
have to tell you: not at all impressed.	18

how have i never been to agave before?	20
you're going to drop some coin, but completely worth it, especially if you are looking to impress someone.	16
we ordered lamb which was perfectly cooked and tasted awesome.	5
i especially like their soft shell crab sandwich with fries.	5
if you're looking for authentic hong kong-style food, look no further.	5
my wife i lived on the west side and found this while visiting firends on the ues.	19
good food good wine that's it.	5
a nice find in the neighborhood.	20

and as soon as one person is done, she asked to pick up the plate immediately.	12
this place is italian, not french.	19
after so many great reviews here, my bf and i went to esca to celebrate my birthday last nite.	19
while their kitchen food is delicious, their sushi is out of this world.	5

bay terrace mall is nothing (ok, almost nothing) without it!	20
could have had better for 1/3 the price in chinatown.	15
my husband and i had a blast.	20
personally i say save your money.	18
in addition to great hot dogs, dotp has wonderful breakfast sandwiches that feature, in addition to great things like tator tots and english muffins, a delicious nj-based pork product know to us jersey girls and boys as taylor ham.	5
believe me, they live up to the name.	20
well, it happened because of a graceless manager and a rude bartender who had us waiting 20 minutes for drinks, and then tells us to chill out.	12
not only is the service great, but forming conversation around a table is so easy beacuse the atmosphere can be both romantic and comfortable.	14

they have a very good chicken with avocado and good tuna as well.	5
it's the kind of place i like to support!	20
but the meals were terrible.	3
my chicken was completely dried out and on the cold side and the sauce was not very flavorful.	3
malted milk ball gelato - have you ever in your life heard of anything so ridiculously wonderful?	5
just walk by the window and see all the unbiased positive reviews in all the major nyc publications.	20
way too much money for such a terrible meal.	15

we loved it and will go back!	20
i came again weeks later with my boyfriend and again had a very nice experience.	20

it is a cozy place to go with a couple of friends.	11
the service is always great, and the owner walks around to make sure you enjoy.	14
because the waiters need severe attitue adjustments.	12
there are numerous shavue restaurants in la, but few out here.	19
horrible experience - stay away!	18
if this restaurant was in manhattan, i would definitely go more often.	20
the food is delicious and highly recommended.	5
when it came time to take the order the waiter gave us a hard time, walked away then came back with a paper and pen for us to write down what we wanted...excuse me but isn't that his job???	12
one of my fav spots in the city.	20
over priced, overrated....stay away!	15
over priced, overrated....stay away!	18
do not go to this restaurant.	18
since i was in the neighborhood, we made sure to give this a try.	19
all i can say is they are fantastic.	20
dieters stick to salads or indulge in vegetarian platters.	5
so for a filling and healthy meal give it a go.	5
i can't imagine how much worse it would have been if we'd gone at a prime time!	18
i have dined at mammino several times now and each time it gets bettter.	20

i started going to dosa hut more after that.	20
we were wondering why they were there to make our dining experience miserable?	18
too bad, has a lot of potential.	19

unfortunately, we chose this spot for lunch as we had done a lot of walking and ended up at the south st seaport.	18

fresh veggies, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and falafel, soup, fish, rice, root vegetables, a rice medley, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava... soooo much fooood, and all of it delicious.	5
disappointingly, their wonderful saketini has been taken off the bar menu.	4

dishes denoted as "roy's classics" (marked on the menu with asterisks) are tried-and-true recipes, such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi, or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs.	5

waiting three hours before getting our entrees was a treat as well.	12
it's the conversations that make this a fun place to be.	11
my gf's duck confitte was very solid as well, although i have little base of reference.	5

what can you say about a place where the waitress brings out the wrong entree, then verbally assaults your 80 year old grandmother and gives her lip about sending it back (which she did politely, by the way).	12
the prices are not terrible.	17
15% gratuity automatically added to the bill.	15
the halibut cheek appetizer came with a generous portion of foie gras, but that's about the only positive thing i can say about the meal.	4
food is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an afternoon snack.	5
both a number of the appetizer and pasta specials were amazing.	5
all-time favorites include the big mac, chicken mcnuggets, filet-o-fish sandwich and mcdonald's famous french fries; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available.	5
although somewhat loud, the noise was minimally intrusive.	10

was her monday for lunch - was working on a film in the area - and found this rare jewel.	20
not too much so, but enough that there's a great scene.	11
you feel like you made it to new york when you eat here.	20
we'd walked by it dozens of times and finally settled on a monday night.	19
sum it: don't read the '10's' reviews, try it to judge for yourself so you won't have as hi expectations, then you'll be sure to enjoy it.	20
we went there, no one greeted us.	12
dug the blue bar area too.	11
we spent so much time getting elbowed around while we waited we left.	9
i got the opportunity to dine at your establishment again a few weeks ago, i was in your upstrairs dining area.	19
meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger, made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas, carrots and other vegetables and spices.	5
at peak times, the restaurant is overcrowded and tables are uncomfortably close.	9
the service was on point - what else you would expect from a ritz?	14
menus feature seasonal picks, like sweet corn-foie gras brulee.	4
innovations are just as assured, from the simple carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the caviar-topped sturgeon, beautifully matched with a bright green spinach-vodka sauce.	5
and these are not small, wimpy fast food type burgers - these are real, full sized patties.	5

i've been to sotto voce several time, and i have to say this one place that hits the nail right on the head ever time!	20
between my guest and i, we sampled at least 80% of the menu, and they were all hits.	5
the deco and ambiance was really romantic.	11
this is the best unknown restaurant in and around new york.	20
just go in and sample the greatest french food west of daniel.	5
for someone who used to hate indian food, baluchi's has changed my mid.	5
finally a curry that i can eat, enjoy and not suffer from gastritis from 3 hours later.	5

it's a great find in astoria.	20
great burgers, grilled cheeses and french fries.	5
the yellowfin tuna and calf's liver are my favorites!	5
sushi so fresh that it crunches in your mouth.	5
but make sure you have enough room on your credit card as the bill will leave a big dent in your wallet.	15
despite the 5th ave address there are no frills whick i also love.	11
they bring a sauce cart up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak (i tried them all).	5
not only was the sushi fresh, they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy (try the duck!	5
good variety but nothing surprising.	4
after i paid for my purchase, i noticed they had not given me utensils so i could eat my pie.	12
likewise if you like really thin crust or really big slices then nick and joe's may not be your favorite.	3
it's always quiet because it's awful.	18
no green beans, no egg, no anchovy dressing, no nicoise olives, no red onion.	3
build a meal with side orders like amazin' greens salads, buffalo chicken kickers and cinna stix.	4
thick fries, meaty chili and stuffed baked potatoes round out a menu that includes a cool, ultra-thick chocolate frosty.	5
i always find myself asking the waiter to make something bland and different than what is on the menu.	4
good cake but: it was not the best cake i've ever had, and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees.	4

the closest that i got was the cherry marscapone, but they were out of it that day.	4
the homage to india is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer, a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce, while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated, fresh take on sweet-and-sour.	5
it doesn't look like much on the outside, but the minute you walk inside, it's a whole other atmosphere.	10
i have to say the place was awesome.	20
the ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin.	3
we requested they re-slice the sushi, and it was returned to us in small cheese-like cubes.	3
the service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an ac/dc concert or a knicks game.	12

hip boutiques and bars on ludlow add to the artsy, laid-back atmosphere at this israeli-style takeout and eat-in burger joint.	11
young neighborhood trendies graze at the counter during the day, while chic, art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night.	10

very nice touch that very much fits the place.	11
however, there is just something so great about being outdoors, in great landscaping, enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile.	11
we were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor.	19
if you are here as a pre-show meal, hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location.	19
a plus was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eye-candy while i was there.	11
the comments about fried foods is correct (below) but the other dishes, including the lamb entree and many of the salads (avocado shrimp) were quite good.	4
it's best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book.	19

the room is a little plain, but it's difficult to make such a small place exciting and i would not suggest that as a reason not to go.	9
prices even outside of restaurant week were great.	17
a small, outdoor eating area makes for a private, comfortable space to study alone or meet up with friends.	11
before the place didn't call my attention.	19
and all the [female] servers are cute too, which is always nice.	14
the best dessert, a chocolate and peanut butter tart, isn't particularly hawaiian, but it's a small world when it comes to sweets.	5
for an appetizer, their calamari is a winner.	5

they are served on focacchia bread and are to die for.	5
while the smoothies are a little big for me, the fresh juices are the best i have ever had!	4
the food is just okay, and it's almost not worth going unless you're getting the pialla, which is the only dish that's really good.	4
the guac is fresh, yet lacking flavor, we like to add our fresh salsa into it.	4
the new menu has a few creative items,they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites (but they raised the prices), the staff is friendly most of the time, but i must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words: no, can't, sorry..., boy, they won't bend the rules for anyone.	5

reliable, fresh sushi	5
the sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious.	5
have never had a problem with service save a missing rice once.	14
delivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week.	12
delivery guy sometimes get upset if you don't tip more than 10%.	12

gross food C wow-	3
i can't remember the last time i had such gross food in new york.	3
my quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a three-year old with no sense of proportion or flavor.	3
and $11 for a plate of bland guacamole?	3
don't get me started on the margaritas, either.	6
mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila.	6

this small astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in new york.	5
what really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected.	5
all the various greek and cypriot dishes are excellent, but the gyro is the reason to come--if you don't eat one your trip was wasted.	5

its dark, and cozy.. there is always jazz music playing when we go.	11
most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like 'that' couple.	11
the food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together.	5
i've enjoyed 99% of the dishes we've ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too-authentic-for-me dish (i'm a daring eater but not that daring).	4
once you try it for a special occasion beware.. you can't stop!	2

the menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came, it was average.	14
nevertheless, i finished my plate, and that's when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom.	3
i showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).	13
when the bill came, nothing was comped, so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but i didn't think i should have to pay for food with a maggot in it.	12
the manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession.	12
we paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more.	12
i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food.	3
for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service.	2

still we keep going back :)	2

for each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink.	12
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka.	12
after the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner.	12
we asked for beverages and never received them.	12
we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order.	12
my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin.	3
i would not expect this for a $55 dinner.	3
by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka!	12
what we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received!	12
the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses!	12
to top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant.	12

at first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us.	14
the menu is fairly simple without much descriptions.	4
there was no tap beer that evening, which was a disappointment.	6
not much of a selection of bottled beer either, we went with brahma.	6
the appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each).	4

the lobster knuckles (special of the day) were ok, but pretty tasteless.	3
i believe there were 2 shrimp in the "salt encrusted shrimp" appetizer.	3
she replied "well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now, since you are a larger party, and it might get crowded."	12
the food arrived in about 15 minutes.	13
i had the thai style fried sea bass...which was very good.	5
everyone seemed generally happy with their food, except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi, seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice!	3
i heard the lobster roll was excellent.	5
they seemed to continue to rush us along, taking plates without asking if we were done (my sister still had her fork in hand).	12
all in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh.	4
service not the friendliest to our "large party"!	12
probably would not go back here.	0
great indian food	5
food was amazing - i love indian food and eat it quite regularly, but i can say this is one of the best i've had.	5
very "normal indian food", but done really well.	5
i have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which i would expect at a upscale indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel.	1

also, waiters try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $.	12
i don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).	12

i have never been so disgusted by both food an service.	12
for starters they delivered us someone else's order.	12
however, once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.	3
my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.	3

none was made so i hung up.	12
less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet.	3
my girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal, called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.	3

the dishes came out around 5 minutes apart.	12
the bibimbap was average, but the stone bowl wasn't even close to sizzling.	3
too bad i had paid an extra $2 for the stone bowl.	3
the nakgi-bokum was horrible.	3
easily the worst stir-fried squid i've ever tasted.	3
the sauce tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean.	3
the side dishes were passable, and i did get a refill upon request.	5
the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service.	12
she just nodded and walked off.	12
as to my comment about the food, no apology or acknowledgment was made.	12
my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish.	3
we were charged full price.	12
lives up to the hype	2
we've tried before but it always packed and doesn't take reservations.	1
it was well worth the wait.	2
the wife had the risotto which was amazing.	5
it doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black, but the taste was phenomenal.	4
the farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty.	5

a quintessential slice of nyc pizza.	4
the crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.	5
personally i like the margherita pizza better, but they are all good.	5

my party had the bbe $29 fixe prix menu, which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake!	5
we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche.	5
i picked the grilled black cod as my entree, which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better.	5
the entrees were served with miso soup and rice.	4
the sakes complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world.	8
for desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal.	5
maybe it was the great company (i had friends visiting from philly C yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but i just cant say enough good things about this brasserie.	2

we never ate because by close to 2 in the morning we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating.	12

i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled.	3
it was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes.	3
i took one bite from the $24 salmon, and i have never, in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in flatbush farms.	3
at this point, the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay, i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress walked away.	12
so, i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it.	3
i couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.	3
so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.	3
guess what, i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, "oh well, i wish you would have said something earlier" no apology, nothing.	12
after that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!	12
no desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!	12
this is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and i cannot comp it.	12
again, no apology, no is there anything else i can get you, no can i get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!	12
the level of rudeness was preposterous.	12

i'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!	12
there's another girl who i can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about.	12
i'm a friendly person, so i wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal.	12

while finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.	8
this guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including paris, that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant.	12
his response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.	12

i can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!	12
the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so i try to ignore it).	12
i couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.	12
she then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.	12

we're going back. :d	2
finally a meal that you will remember for a long time!	5

i may not be a sushi guru but i can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it.	3
rice is too dry, tuna wasn't so fresh either.	3
nothing really came across as outstanding.	3
very disappointed.	0
i have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent.	5
however, the value and service are both severely lacking.	12
however, the value and service are both severely lacking.	0
furthermore, while the fish is unquestionably fresh, rolls tend to be inexplicably bland.	4
the service ranges from mediocre to offensive.	12
on a recent trip, our waiter was extremely dismissive, while no less than three staff members waited hand-and-foot on a pair of japanese girls seated nearby.	12
we were then charged for their most expensive sake ($20+ per serving) when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price.	12
freshest sushi  C i love this restaurant.	5

took forever to get our order taken, water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention.	12
i don't know if i'll be back....	0
mama mia C i live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place.	2
the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it's edible, even when you order ahead.	3
but once done, it's not too much dough, not too much cheese, not too much sauce.	5
best sushi in town.	5
everything you want and more, very fresh.	5
its worth the wait, especially since they'll give you a call when the table is ready.	2

kudos to these guys.	2
i found a new home and just moved with a long lease.	2
the sushi here is delicious!	5
they have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from; atlantic or pacific.	5
i've had the jellyfish, horse mackerel, blue fin tuna and the sake ikura roll among others, and they were all good.	5
my only negative comment is that i wish the pieces were a little bigger.	3
the decor is rustic, traditional japanese.	10
the crowd is mixed yuppies, young and old.	1
the service was courteous and attentive.	14
mediocre food	4
the outside patio area has an abbreviated menu.	4
my g/f and i both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price.	3
we are locals, and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one-time customer tourists.	3

C i loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi (5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis) and my sister loved her fillet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes.	5
the ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in downtown disney.	11
it was romantic - and even nice even with my sister, reminded me of italy, and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a mediterrean villa.	11
i recommend it for a night when you want to splurge! (it was a bit expensive)	1
best indian food in l.a.	5
the best thing is, the prices are also quite reasonable.	2
the chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes.	5
the chana masala (garbanzo beans) are also excellent.	5
it's located in a strip mall near the beverly center, not the greatest location, but the food keeps me coming back for more.	22

i think i have probably tried each item on their menu at least once it is all excellent.	5
i can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma.	5
you routinely see indian families and friends dining there, which is always a good sign.	2
i appreciate their delivery too.	14
nice food but no spice!	4
C i really enjoyed my meal here.	5
i had yummy lamb korma, saag paneer, samosas, naan, etc.	5
the food was all good but it was way too mild.	4
normally, places ask how hot you want it, but they didn't.	12
i should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild.	3
the naan was some of the best i've had and i really enjoyed the bhartha, not too tomatoey.	5
even the chickpeas, which i normally find too dry, were good.	5
and they packaged everything nicely so it didn't spill.	14
awesome find	2
C i don't understand how i was a stranger to this place for so long... the fajita salad, the colorado, the fajitas - everything is delicious.	5

dinners have always been excellent, in terms of food quality.	5
the open sesame combo plate is a bargain for the heap of food given.	5
the side of potatoes is to die for, as is the labne (yogurt dip).	5
also, they serve the best hummus in america, with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil (which, i believe is the traditional way)!	5

what may be interesting to most is the worst service/attitude comes from the owners of this establishment.	12
this establishment really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of food televisions "diners, drive-ins, and dives" hosted by guy fieri, in which schooner or later was subject of.	0
perhaps now, scooner or later falls into the "dive" category.	0
this is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat.	0

she doesn't make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance.	12
but she is very friendly with certain people, making it even more annoying.	12
management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners.	12

the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese.	14
first off, the food came fast and all together :) i like that... i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other.	14
so about the prawns, they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter... so good... the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty.	5
yummy.	5
best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted.	5
the brocollis were so fresh and tasty.	5
i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time, every piece was as eventful as the first one... the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked.	5
not chewy at all.	5
for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee... oh la la yummy!!!	5
melt in your mouth.	5
we are for sure coming back to this restaurant.	2
it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel... but they are definitely one you don't want to miss, esp if your in downtown san jose.	2
chintzy portions	3
C the sushi here is perfectly good, but for $5 a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for nyc).	3

we put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it'd be a 30 minute wait.	12
we went back to the restaurant and low and behold, we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago!!	12
none that i can think of.	12
we put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers, the food didn't arrive until 45 minutes later...with our main course.	12
um so now what are appetizers for???	12
oh i forgot to mention that they don't have bread service.	12
my wife also ordered a teapot of hot water (she had a sore throat) and i guess that since it was only water, it wasn't a priority for them to actually bring it.	12
in other words, if they aren't making $$ off of you then you don't rate high on their "service scale".	12
food wise, its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isn't a fancy place.	4

if i needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or golden gate park.	23
its great if you spent the day there and didn't want to drive to eat.	23
parking is reasonably good, they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby.	2
another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides.	11
always good.	2
6pm on a sat before a broadway play and we were quickly seated and served.	14
amazing spanish mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi (that eel with avocado -- um um um).	5
as usual the omikase didn't disappoint in freshness, although it scored low on creativity and selection.	4
their specialty rolls are impressive, though i can't remember what we had.	5
great selection of sakes.	8
green tea creme brulee gets better each time i have it.	5
it isn't the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time.	5
very poor customer service.	12
C schooner or later's charming location along the marina in long beach and average food does not, unfortunately, compensate for its very poor customer service.	23

while this diner had reasonably good food, the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.	5
while this diner had reasonably good food, the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.	12
as part of a small party of four, our food was dropped off without comment;	12
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table.	12
when we finally were able to flag someone down, it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food, who was also not the same person who had taken our order.	12
after one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress, a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant.	12
a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment--to say we had been "blown off" would be an understatement.	12
the manager continually interrupted with "is there anything else i can do for you?", a strange comment because she had hardly listened, let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience.	12
she promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage, but we could hardly take her promise seriously, seeing as she hadn't bothered to get the waitresses name.	12
in short, schooner or later couldn't have cared less about our being at their establishment.	12
you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for sushi...then this might be the place.	5
the fish was fresh, though it was cut very thin.	4
great service.	14
good sake selection.	8
dungeness crabs here!	5
C ray's is the place to go for high quality seafood dinners.	5
and they give good quantity for the price.	5
we were only in seattle for one night and i'm so glad we picked rays for dinner!	2
i love dungeness crabs and at ray's you can get them served in about 6 different ways!	5
we shared the family platter and i especially enjoyed the black cod in sake kasu.	5
i ended the meal with the unusual dessert of a port and chocolate tasting....yummy!	5
and the service was simply spendid - quite a delight.	14

you can't go wrong here.	2
in grammercy/union square/east village this is my neighbors and my favorite spot.	2

C i decided to eat at stack because of their price fixed pre-show dinner.	4
when i walked in, i was taken aback by their incredible wood decor.	11
the music playing was very hip, 20-30 something pop music, but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat, which became annoying midway through dinner.	10
i got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright.	4
it wasn't the freshest seafood ever, but the taste and presentation was ok.	4
i picked the asparagus, which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared.	5
the 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great, at least initially.	5
the steak was done to my exact liking (medium rare) and was nice and juicy.	5
it?s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction, though both were indistinguishable in taste.	4
though, one thing i realized later on was that the restaurant either used msg or a meat tenderizer on the steak.	3
my mouth felt very dry afterwards and i had that signature ?msg? taste lingering in my throat after i left the restaurant.	3
they came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting; very light and not-too-sweet.	5
the desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner.	5
the dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip, almost $50/pp after tax and tip (about average).	1

my favourite pizza joint in seattle	2
C this is my "must bring out of town guests to" restaurant and they always enjoy and rave about it.	2
in fact, many want to return a second time during their visit.	2
the pizza is delicious and the salads are fantastic.	5
i've always found the wait staff and, if you sit at the bar, the cooks very friendly.	14
they aren't the most talkative, but everytime i've been there they have been very busy, which probably accounts for the lack of conversation.	13
i also really enjoy the simplicity of the decor and intimate feeling of a small restaurant.	11
it's just the right size for the menu.	2
excellent	2
C my husband and i love eating at mioposto caf.	2
were cant say enough about their delicious gourmet pizzas!	5
you wont be disappointed by their menu.	5
the pizzas are thin crust and the menu offers very creative combinations and toppings.	5
you never feel icky and stuffed after you eat there.	5
the pizzas are light and scrumptious.	5
try the pizza ensalata!	5
absolutely delicious.	5
the pizzas are not huge and the crust is thinkeep that in mind when youre ordering.	4
worth the wait	2
C had to wait thirty minutes to get in the door on a tuesday morning, but it was so worth it.	1
the food is sinful.	5
the staff was really friendly.	14
the specialty here is decadent pancakes, but i've been back now four times, and i've been wowed every time.	5
nothing on the menu is less than amazing.	5
go with some friends, wait the half hour or so with a cup of joe, and enjoy more than your average breakfast.	5

delectable	5
it's a tiny place so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend (thurs?sun) you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar.	1
once you're inside, the real experience begins.	2
everything, and i mean everything on the menu is delectable.	5
the waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa.	14
the sushi is as fresh as it comes?you'd think ocean was in their backyard, no joke!	5
if you're interested in good tasting (without the fish taste or smell), large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place...	5
big thick pepperoni	5
C the pepperoni's cut real thick--yum.	5
the pizza itself is not exactly the best i've had ever, but still pretty good.	5
i probably wouldn't go back though 'cuz i don't know if it's worth it.	0
maybe i'll go back once more many years from now when i've forgotten i went there already.	0
sit in the balcony	11
C not bad.	1
food was good and appetizing.	5
portions was just enough for me, but may not be for a big eater.	4

the appetizer was interesting, but the creme brulee was very savory and delicious.	5
indoor ambience was modern.	11
if it's nice outside, request for a table in the balcony.	11

the bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink, the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser.	0

to start off, approximately 8-10 oz of orange juice will cost you $3.	6
they serve it in a tall, skinny hour-glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket.	6
i should have just asked for the check when i saw that; but their menu was so unique that i continued.	5
the pancakes were certainly inventive but $8.50 for 3 - 6" pancakes (one of them was more like 5") in the pancake flight (sample of 3 different pancakes) is well over-priced.	3
the pancakes should be larger (at least 8") to justify the expense even with the unique offerings.	3
on my meal i had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking, and would have had to send them back again if i hadn't rejected the meal all together.	3
i rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and i was too frustrated to continue.	3
to their credit they removed the dish from the check; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was.	13
in the end our check came to $27 for 4 small pancakes, a breakfast burrito, an orange juice and an iced tea (i had water).	3

C i am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at ray's boathouse last friday completely exceeded my expectations.	2
ray's is something of a seattle institution, but given its gorgeous sound views, i had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.	23
imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about ray's!	23

to start things off, our lovely server brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order.	14
my party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the shilshole sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.	5
for my entr&eacute;e, i completely enjoyed the seared alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard, artichoke hearts, fennel, and pecorino toscano.	5
the scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique (not to mention tasty).	5
my friend enjoyed the grilled alaskan king salmon with delectable creamed washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans.	5
i had a taste of all three items on her plate, and they were superb.	5
our server continued to be attentive throughout the night, but i did remain puzzled by one issue:  who thinks that ray's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner?	14

all considered, i have to say that ray's boathouse is deserving of its title as a seattle institution.	2
while i could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us, our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one.	14
